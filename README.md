This was an academic mini-project in which I discover a little bit Java EE multi-tiers architecture by building my first ever CRUD under Sir
Amine Lamine "Senior Research Scientist at United Technologies Research Center and Assistant Professor of Computer Science  
in the Faculty of Sciences of Gabes" guidance.
Beautiful small memories xD.
